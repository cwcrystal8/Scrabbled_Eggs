## How to Play
To start playing our game, just like the real life game, our program allows up to 4 players to play at once. Each person will be given 7 tiles which are all randomly drawn from a bag of tiles. Each turn, a user is given the following 7 options:
  
<b>(1) Add a word to the board </b>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allows the user to add a word to the board given a location and direction  
<b>(2) See the manual  </b>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;displays a menu showing what the colored tiles on the board means  
<b>(3) Pass my turn  </b>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if a player cannot make any moves, he/she can pass his/her turn to the other player  
<b>(4) See the board </b>   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;redisplays board to the user  
<b>(5) See my tiles  </b>  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;redisplays tiles a user has  
<b>(6) Exit the game </b>   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;quits the game  
<b>(7) Display player scores </b>   
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;displays the points each user has  
  
There are no required libraries so you're set to go!
